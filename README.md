# Explanation of my accounts

Hi, this is Jeff. I am an undergraduate student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My majors are: Computer Science, Risk Management and Business Intelligence. I have decided to pursue a career in quant (researcher/trader). This is a tough decision given that my previous experience is mainly with Machine Learning / Deep Learning. But "the experience is so enjoyable that I will continue to do it even at a great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it." (This comes from the definition of [Flow](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Quotes). I saw this from [Flow Traders](http://flowtraders.com) which is one of my most favorite companies.)

This account is a collection of all my accounts. I separate my work into different accounts because I want to keep them clean. [@Jeff-HOU](https://github.com/Jeff-HOU) account is my main account which I have used for years. Most of my previous work is there. Recently, I am working on web development, so I separate the work into [@webdev-jeff](https://github.com/webdev-jeff). I am also going to create a math account for myself to keep track of my learning plan in Statistics, Probability, and Stochastic Calculus.
